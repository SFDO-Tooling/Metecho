In order to facilitate your contributions to the Open Source Commons’ applications and sprint projects, you will need to access and use Salesforce.org’s proprietary Metecho tool. These Metecho Terms of Service (“Agreement”) govern the use of our tool. Please read this Agreement carefully because it is a binding agreement between You and Salesforce.com, Inc. (“Salesforce” or “We”).</0><1>BY ACCEPTING THIS AGREEMENT, BY (1) CLICKING A BOX INDICATING ACCEPTANCE OR (2) ACKNOWLEDGING ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT IN A SEPARATE DOCUMENT REFERENCING OR INCORPORATING THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. IF THE INDIVIDUAL ACCEPTING THIS AGREEMENT IS ACCEPTING ON BEHALF OF A COMPANY OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY, SUCH INDIVIDUAL REPRESENTS THAT THEY HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO BIND SUCH ENTITY AND ITS AFFILIATES TO THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, IN WHICH CASE THE TERM “YOU” SHALL REFER TO SUCH ENTITY AND ITS AFFILIATES. IF THE INDIVIDUAL ACCEPTING THIS AGREEMENT DOES NOT HAVE SUCH AUTHORITY, OR DOES NOT AGREE WITH THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, SUCH INDIVIDUAL MUST NOT ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT AND MAY NOT USE THE METECHO TOOL.</1><2>Please note that we offer many services. Your use of Salesforce products or services are provided by Salesforce pursuant to a separate manually or digitally-executed agreement. The Metecho tool is not considered a Service under the Salesforce Master Subscription Agreement, which does not apply to the use of the Metecho tool.</2><3>This Agreement was last updated on March 30, 2020. It is effective between you and Salesforce as of the date you accept this Agreement.</3><4>The Metecho Tool</4><5>Salesforce.org’s Metecho tool is a proprietary web-based tool for collaborating on Salesforce projects. The Metecho tool runs on Heroku.</5><6>The Metecho tool will be used for multiple purposes, including, but not limited to:</6><7><0>Creating the project team and assigning work;</0><1>Provisioning Salesforce scratch orgs for you to do your development work in; and</1><2>Retrieving your development work from the scratch org and committing it to the public open source, SFDO-Community-Sprints GitHub repository.</2></7><8>The Metecho tool does not access your real production or sandbox org, and it does not access any Customer Data as that term is defined in the Salesforce Master Subscription Agreement. You do not have to use the Metecho tool in order to access the SFDO-Community-Sprints GitHub repository.</8><9>Your Use of the Metecho Tool</9><10>Please do not use the Metecho tool in a way that violates any laws, infringes anyone’s rights, is offensive, or interferes with the Sites or any features on the Sites (including any technological measures we employ to enforce this Agreement).</10><11>It should be common sense so we won’t bore you with a list of things you shouldn’t do. But if we (in our sole discretion) determine that you have acted inappropriately, we reserve the right to delete your code from our repository, terminate your ability to use the Metecho tool, prohibit you from participating in our Open Source Commons or other sprints, prohibit you from contributing to our repository, and take appropriate legal action.</11><12>Beta Version</12><13>The Metecho tool is still in beta. It is not generally available to customers, and is only available to users participating in the Open Source Community Sprint.</13><14>Per the terms of this Agreement, Salesforce shall make the Metecho tool available to you, and shall grant you a non-transferable, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive license to use the Metecho tool in object code form, at no charge. You shall only access the Metecho tool for the purpose(s) described by Salesforce. The Metecho tool is for evaluation purposes only, is provided as-is, is not supported, and may be subject to additional terms.</14><15>Your GitHub Account</15><16>In order to contribute to Salesforce.org’s open source products, you will be required to have a GitHub account. By signing up for GitHub, you agree to GitHub’s Terms of Service and Privacy Statement and to provide GitHub with the information necessary to create and/or maintain your account.</16><17>Access to Your GitHub Account</17><18>In order to facilitate contribution, the Metecho tool requires access to your GitHub account including, but not limited to, the personal data and code repositories associated with your account, in order to carry out actions on your behalf via the GitHub API.</18><19>Personal Data Associated with Your GitHub Account</19><20>The Metecho tool may access your name, email address, GitHub username, GitHub account information information, GitHub profile picture and any repositories associated with your GitHub account. Other Metecho users participating in the Open Source Community Sprint will be able to see your publicly available GitHub profile picture and username.</20><21>Purposes of Access to Your GitHub Account</21><22>Specifically, the Metecho tool will access your GitHub account, including your associated personal data, for the following purposes:</22><23><0>Find which repositories you have contributor access to</0><1>Create branches in the repository</1><2>Commit files to branches</2><3>Monitor commit history</3><4>Create Pull Requests to submit your work for review and merge into the project</4></23><24>Proprietary Rights</24><25>Subject to the limited rights expressly granted under this Agreement, Salesforce and its licensors reserve all rights, title and interest in and to the Metecho tool (including reports, data, assessments, analyses or compilations of data, collected by, derived from, created by or returned by the Metecho tool, including any derivative works thereof), including all related intellectual property rights. No rights are granted to you hereunder other than as expressly set forth herein. Subject to the limited licenses granted herein, Salesforce acquires no right, title or interest from you or your licensors under this Agreement, including to program code.</25><26>License Information</26><27>By using the Metecho tool and participating in the Open Source Community Sprint, you agree that any work or code you write while using the Metecho tool (a) will be made available in the SFDO-Community-Sprints GitHub repository and (b) is subject to Salesforce’s Contributor License Agreement.</27><28>You also agree that both the Metecho tool and any work you do while participating in the Open Source Community Sprint are licensed by Salesforce.org under the BSD-3 Clause License, found at <2>https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause</2>.</28><29>Feedback</29><30>If you provide feedback to Salesforce regarding the Metecho tool, you agree that Salesforce shall have a royalty-free, worldwide, irrevocable, perpetual license to use and incorporate into the Metecho tool, and successor tools, any suggestion, enhancement request, recommendation, correction or other feedback provided by you, relating to the operation of the Metecho tool, and any successor tools, for use by Salesforce and users of its offerings.</30><31>No Warranty</31><32>THE METECHO TOOL IS PROVIDED “AS-IS,” EXCLUSIVE OF ANY WARRANTY WHATSOEVER WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE. SALESFORCE DISCLAIMS ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. SALESFORCE DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY FOR ANY HARM OR DAMAGES CAUSED BY ANY THIRD PARTY HOSTING PROVIDERS.</32><33>The Metecho tool may contain bugs or errors. Any participation in or use of the Metecho tool is at your sole risk. You acknowledge that Salesforce may discontinue the Metecho tool at any time in its sole discretion, and may never make an applicable successor tool available.</33><34>No Damages</34><35>IN NO EVENT SHALL SALESFORCE HAVE ANY LIABILITY HEREUNDER TO YOU FOR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR DAMAGES BASED ON LOST PROFITS, DATA OR USE, INCLUDING ANY DAMAGES CAUSED BY THE METECHO TOOL ACCESSING YOUR GITHUB ACCOUNT, AND ANY REPOSITORIES OR PERSONAL DATA ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR GITHUB ACCOUNT, HOWEVER CAUSED AND, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR UNDER ANY OTHER THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER OR NOT YOU HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES UNLESS SUCH DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY IS NOT ENFORCEABLE UNDER APPLICABLE LAW.</35><36>Assignment</36><37>You may not assign any of its rights or obligations hereunder, whether by operation of law or otherwise, without the prior written consent of Salesforce (not to be unreasonably withheld).</37><38>Agreement to Governing Law</38><39>This Agreement is governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of California, without regard to its conflict of laws rules. You expressly agree that the exclusive jurisdiction for any claim or dispute under this Agreement and or your use of the Metecho tool resides in the courts located in San Francisco, California, and you further expressly agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purpose of litigating any such claim or action.
