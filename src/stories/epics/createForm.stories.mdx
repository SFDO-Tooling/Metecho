# CreateEpicModal

**Initializes details of a new Epic.**

The **CreateEpicModal** component is a form used for entering inital options
when creating a new **Epic**.

In addition to a mandatory field for the **Epic** `name`, there is also an
optional `description` field. Radio buttons allow for making a selection between
creating a new GitHub branch or using an existing one for the new **Epic**. If
the "Use existing GitHub branch" radio is selected, a
[combobox](https://react.lightningdesignsystem.com/components/comboboxes/) is
rendered to allow the user to search for and select an existing branch.

Pressing the "Create" button creates the **Epic** and closes the modal.
