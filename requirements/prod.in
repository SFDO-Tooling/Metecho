# psycopg2 is used as the database driver for Django to connect to PostgreSQL.
# It is LGPL-licensed and we must follow these rules for compliance with Salesforce 3rd-party software policy:
# 1. Salesforce code only links to unmodified (binary, if applicable) copies of the 3rd-party code
# 2. Salesforce code only dynamically (not statically) links to the 3rd-party code
# 3. Salesforce code does not derive from, is not based on, and remains separate (aside from linking) from the requested code
